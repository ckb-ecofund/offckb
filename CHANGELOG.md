# @offckb/cli

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2054548: Add Fiber (FNN) support to the local devnet. The devnet genesis now carries the Fiber contracts `auth`, `funding_lock` and `commitment_lock` (pinned to the FNN v0.9.0-rc7 source), and a new `offckb fiber` command family manages a local Fiber environment: `offckb node --fiber` starts CKB, miner, RPC proxy and FNN nodes in one go, while `offckb fiber start` adds FNN nodes to an already-running devnet (with `--daemon`/`offckb fiber stop` for background operation). Each node gets its own built-in CKB account (node N → account N+2), network identity, RPC port 21713+N, P2P port 8343+N and a `fnn.log`; `offckb fiber status [--json]` reports live node health, `offckb fiber logs --node <id>` reads node logs, and `offckb fiber clean [--data]` removes stores or the whole fiber environment. Startup verifies the devnet spec, CKB and every FNN agree on the same chain and checks node identity keys, funding accounts and balances. Plain local devnet only — mainnet/testnet and forked devnets are rejected. `offckb clean` now also removes fiber stores with `--data` and refuses to delete data while a CKB/fiber daemon or a live FNN store lock can be confirmed. New devnets only: devnets initialized by earlier offckb versions lack the Fiber contracts and must be rebuilt (`offckb clean`) to use Fiber, which changes the genesis hash.

## 0.4.13

### Patch Changes

- 0923956: Fix two CLI UX bugs reported in #498:

  - `offckb balance` without an address no longer leaks the SDK's `Unknown address format undefined`. The address argument is now required, so commander prints a clear `error: missing required argument 'toAddress'`.
  - Commander parameter/option errors (unknown option, invalid option value, missing argument) are printed exactly once on stderr instead of twice.

## 0.4.12

### Patch Changes

- a591136: Update the ckb-tui download URL to the new `nervosnetwork/ckb-tui` org repository after ckb-tui was transferred out of the original personal repo. Release assets moved with the transfer, so the pinned SHA-256 digests still match byte-for-byte and verified installs are unaffected.
- e156a5a: Fix `offckb debug` failing with `ENOENT` on the tx-file path. The debugger now splits its command line quote-aware, so the quotes `encodeBinPathForTerminal` adds around space-containing paths are stripped instead of becoming part of the file name (a regression from the native ckb-debugger switch, which passes array argv to `execFileSync` instead of a shell string).
- 4f27ae9: Add `offckb install ckb-debugger` to install the native `ckb-debugger` binary. Instead of compiling from source with `cargo install` (which needs a Rust toolchain), offckb now downloads the prebuilt release asset for the current platform from the official ckb-standalone-debugger GitHub releases, verifies its SHA-256 digest, publishes it under the offckb data directory, and puts a `ckb-debugger` shim next to the offckb binary so generated projects can find it on PATH. `offckb create` installs the native debugger automatically when it is missing. The bundled WASM debugger and its fallback logic have been removed — `offckb debug` now requires the native binary. Version checks against the configured minimum now compare numerically, so an installed binary that satisfies `tools.ckbDebugger.minVersion` is correctly recognized.
- 852b68b: Fix review findings from the v0.4.11 release merge. `offckb logs script` now scans a wider window before filtering so sparse script entries are not missed, and an unknown `offckb logs` target is rejected instead of silently reading the node log. `offckb logs -f` detects log rotation by inode change, so a rotated-in file that is already larger than the old one is re-read from the start. `offckb logs --tail` rejects zero and negative values instead of printing the entire filtered log. CKB 0.205.0 prerelease binaries (rc builds), including prereleases of newer versions, are now correctly treated as Terminal-RPC capable during chain init. A ckb-tui binary that lost its execute bit is reinstalled instead of failing at spawn time. The RPC proxy keeps appending events when a proxy.log rollover fails (previously all further events were dropped) and preserves the previous archive when the rollover's rename fails, records batched JSON-RPC requests including batched `send_transaction`, skips malformed batch members without aborting the rest of the batch, and warns instead of misreporting a parse error when `send_transaction` has no usable params. `--verbose` on `offckb node` now also enables the proxy's per-request debug lines.

## 0.4.11

### Patch Changes

- e232028: Fix upgraded installs staying on an old bundled ckb-tui. Releases up to 0.4.10 wrote the entire merged settings object on any `offckb config set` (proxy or ckb-version), freezing the then-current bundled ckb-tui version (v0.1.3) into `settings.json`. After upgrading offckb, that frozen value overrode the new shipped default, so affected users never moved to v0.1.4 — and the stale-binary digest check compares against the configured version, so it never triggered a reinstall for them either. `readSettings` now upgrades a persisted ckb-tui version that is older than the shipped default (a newer hand-set version is still respected), and `writeSettings` no longer persists the version when it merely equals the default.
- 40e2317: Bump the bundled ckb-tui from v0.1.3 to v0.1.4 for `offckb status`. The new release fixes a divide-by-zero panic in ckb-tui's data-sync thread when the connected node has no peers (Officeyutong/ckb-tui#13) — the normal state of a single-node devnet — which permanently froze the Overview, Mempool, Peers, and Blockchain panels within seconds of opening the TUI. SHA-256 digests for the v0.1.4 release assets are pinned in offckb, so the download stays verifiable.
- 178379f: Unify devnet logging around the node's log files and add `offckb logs`. A foreground `offckb node` no longer relays the raw node/miner stdout: the console now shows lifecycle events, live contract script debug output (`debug!` in scripts, streamed over the node's TCP log subscription), submitted transaction hashes, and RPC errors — the full node log stays in `data/logs/run.log` as always, and `--verbose` restores the old firehose. The new `offckb logs [node|script|miner|rpc] [-f] [--grep] [--tail]` command reads those log files (`docker logs` style), so logs are reachable in every run mode — foreground, daemon, or while `offckb status` is attached — and pipe/agent friendly. The RPC proxy is quieter too: per-request lines moved from info to debug, JSON-RPC errors in responses now surface as warnings, and everything the proxy sees is appended to `data/logs/proxy.log` (viewable via `offckb logs rpc`).
- 966926b: Bump default CKB version to 0.208.0
- 01fd059: Fix devnet startup crashing for CKB binaries older than v0.205.0. The devnet ckb.toml template enables the `Terminal` RPC module, which only exists since CKB v0.205.0; older binaries abort at startup with an opaque serde "unknown variant" error, and the legacy-config migration re-added the module on every `offckb node` start even after users removed it by hand. offckb now adapts the devnet config to the CKB version: fresh chains for an old binary are initialized without `Terminal` (the migration also stops re-adding it, while still enabling `tcp_listen_address`), a config that already has `Terminal` paired with an old binary fails fast with an actionable error instead of the serde dump, and an unprobeable custom `--binary-path` that crashes with the tell-tale "unknown variant `Terminal`" message now gets a hint pointing at the cause. The `offckb status` system-metric panels require CKB >= 0.205.0; the README's `status` section says so.

## 0.4.10

### Patch Changes

- 406415e: Change the default devnet log filter from `warn,ckb-script=debug` to `info,ckb-script=debug` in the `ckb.toml` / `ckb-miner.toml` templates (and the config editor's embedded reference templates). A healthy devnet produces almost no `warn`-level output, which left the `offckb status` Logs panel permanently empty and looked broken; `info` keeps the per-block log stream visible while `ckb-script=debug` still surfaces script execution details. Applies to newly initialized chains — edit `[logger] filter` in your existing devnet `ckb.toml` to opt in.

- 699a850: Fix the `status` command showing missing data on devnet: enable the Terminal RPC module and the TCP listen address in the devnet `ckb.toml` template (and the config editor's embedded reference template), and pass the node's TCP listen address to ckb-tui so the system metrics, mempool, and log panels populate correctly. The devnet RPC now binds to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0` so the unauthenticated RPC (including the new host metrics) is no longer reachable from other machines on the network; edit `rpc.listen_address` in the devnet `ckb.toml` if you rely on remote access.
- 45b0e98: Rename `--allow-mainnet-replay-risk` to `--allow-external-key-on-mainnet-fork` (#460) — the old flag remains as a hidden deprecated alias so existing scripts keep working — and apply the fixes left over from the 0.4.9 review (#462):

  - Enforce the Mainnet-fork replay guard (instead of warn-only) in `transfer-all`, `udt issue`, `udt destroy`, and `deploy`, and reject inputs created at or before the fork boundary in those transactions, mirroring `transfer`/`deposit`.
  - Validate `--tx-hash` as a 0x-prefixed 32-byte hex string before it is used in debug cache paths.
  - Read the fork boundary only from the spawned CKB process once it is the RPC listener, so a stale node sharing the port cannot clear the first-run flags.
  - Refuse symlinked entries when copying source chain data for a fork.
  - Accept xUDT type args longer than 32 bytes (owner lock hash plus flags/extension) while keeping SUDT at exactly 32 bytes.
  - Give SUDT and xUDT balance scans independent `maxCells` budgets, return deep clones of the default settings from `readSettings` fallbacks, keep `config set` error messages accurate, preserve the original error in `devnet config`, use `execFile` for process lookups, align the ckb-tui download timeouts, handle cross-device installs, and add the missing Fork Mainnet/Testnet entry to the README table of contents.

- 00bfe6c: Fix the devnet config editor and `status` for existing installs. The config editor's "Edit RPC Modules" dialog now offers the `Terminal` (and `RichIndexer`) modules — its option list was still the pre-ckb-tui hardcoded set, so there was no way to enable `Terminal` from the TUI even though the bundled `ckb.toml` enables it. In addition, starting the node now upgrades a legacy devnet `ckb.toml` in place: configs initialized before the ckb-tui fix never received the `Terminal` RPC module or the enabled `tcp_listen_address` (the template is only copied into fresh config folders, and clearing chain `data/` does not touch config files), which left `offckb status` dashboards empty. The migration adds `"Terminal"` to `rpc.modules` and enables `tcp_listen_address = "127.0.0.1:18114"` while preserving existing comments and custom settings; restart the node to apply.

## 0.4.9

### Patch Changes

- 6f54296: Add daemon mode and structured JSON output for agent-friendly usage, plus a `node stop` command to terminate the daemon.

  - `offckb node --daemon` starts the CKB devnet as a detached background process and writes the PID and logs to the devnet data folder.
  - `offckb --json <command>` emits structured JSON log output for programmatic consumption.
  - `offckb node stop` reads the daemon PID file and gracefully shuts down the daemon, falling back to force-kill if necessary. It now verifies the target process identity, handles stale PID files, and cleans up on error paths.
  - Hardened daemon lifecycle: duplicate daemon starts are rejected, CLI entry resolution supports packaged/npx environments via `OFFCKB_CLI_PATH`, and log/PID directory creation failures are handled gracefully.

- 8f8d0a4: Fix canary DevRel findings across daemon lifecycle, SUDT type args, fork isolation and migration, Indexer readiness, account safety, verified ckb-tui downloads, private-key input, and stable JSON command results.
- b3fe233: Add `offckb devnet fork` to fork an existing mainnet/testnet data directory into the local devnet ([Devnet From Existing Data](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/node/devnet-from-existing-data) flow), plus fork-aware system scripts and local-first debugging.

  - `offckb devnet fork --from <dir> [--source mainnet|testnet] [--spec-file <path>] [--force]` copies the source chain data, imports the matching chain spec, patches it for local mining (Dummy PoW, `cellbase_maturity = 0`, correct `genesis_epoch_length` per chain), verifies the genesis hash, and records the fork state. The first `offckb node` run boots with `--skip-spec-check --overwrite-spec` automatically; `offckb clean` resets back to a pure devnet.
  - Devnet system scripts now self-identify the chain via the genesis hash in `ckb list-hashes`: on a mainnet/testnet fork, genesis scripts come from the chain's own spec and post-genesis deployments (sudt/xudt/omnilock/spore/…) are filled from the well-known static records, so `system-scripts`, transfers, deploys and fee estimation keep working on a fork.
  - The devnet ccc client follows the forked chain too: a mainnet fork uses the `ckb` address prefix.
  - `offckb debug` falls back to fetching the transaction from the node when it is not in the local proxy cache, and the tx dumper now embeds full header objects in `mock_info.header_deps` (previously bare hashes, which broke debugging for transactions with header deps).

- 303f54e: Resolve Dependabot security alerts via pnpm overrides for transitive dependencies:

  - `qs` 6.15.0 → 6.15.2
  - `ip-address` 10.1.0 → 10.1.1
  - `js-yaml` 3.14.2 → 3.15.0 / 4.1.1 → 4.2.0
  - `@babel/core` 7.28.6 → 7.29.7
  - `@eslint/plugin-kit` 0.2.8 → 0.3.4
  - `brace-expansion` 5.0.5 → 5.0.6

  `elliptic` remains unfixed because a patched version (>=6.6.2) is not yet published on npm.

- 43ce3a3: Add `status` command to launch ckb-tui for monitoring CKB network from your node
- 463b2ff: Refactor UDT CLI support: reuse `balance` and `transfer` commands for CKB and UDT queries, and add `offckb udt issue` / `offckb udt destroy` subcommands.

## 0.4.8

### Patch Changes

- Override `form-data@>=4.0.0 <4.0.6` to `4.0.6` to fix CRLF injection (GHSA).
- Override `hono@<4.12.25` to `4.12.25` to fix CORS origin reflection with credentials.

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- 1c17600: Bump @ckb-ccc/core to 1.14.0 to fix the ws vulnerability (ws >= 8.21.0).
- a687c6f: Bump default CKB version to 0.207.0
- 3da9777: Replace ckb-transaction-dumper with ccc-based implementation

  - Rewrite transaction dumper to use ccc Client and molecule codecs
  - Implement dep_group unpacking using ccc.mol
  - Remove ckb-transaction-dumper npm dependency

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- a5592dc: Upgrade default CKB version from 0.201.0 to 0.205.0

  CKB v0.205.0 includes:

  - Terminal module for CKB-TUI
  - Proxy protocol support
  - RPC logs subscription
  - Rust toolchain upgrade to 1.92.0

- 8da140d: fix(cli): standardize private key inputs and fix 0x prefix parsing error (#422)
- fb506f4: fix(create): ensure CKB binary and devnet config before generating scripts

  Fix issue #396 where `offckb create` failed if user hasn't run `offckb node` first.

  **Changes:**

  - Add imports for `installCKBBinary`, `initChainIfNeeded`, and `readSettings`
  - Call `installCKBBinary` to download CKB binary if not exists
  - Call `initChainIfNeeded` to initialize devnet config if not exists
  - Both calls happen before `genSystemScriptsJsonFile` to ensure dependencies are ready

  This makes `offckb create` self-sufficient and doesn't require prior `offckb node` execution.

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 37189f7: fix(devnet): only show init hint for InitializationError

  The `offckb devnet config` command was showing the "run `offckb node` once to initialize devnet config files first" hint for ALL errors, including user input errors like invalid `--set` syntax or validation failures.

  Now the hint is only shown for actual initialization errors (missing config path, ckb.toml, or miner.toml), making error messages clearer and less misleading.

  - Added `InitializationError` class to distinguish initialization errors from user input errors
  - Updated `createDevnetConfigEditor()` to throw `InitializationError` for missing files/paths
  - Modified `devnetConfig()` catch block to only show hint for `InitializationError`
  - Added type safety guard for error handling

  Fixes #406

- e90cfe5: fix(ckb-debugger): lazy-load WASI module to suppress ExperimentalWarning

  Convert static import of node:wasi to dynamic import with caching.
  This prevents the ExperimentalWarning from being emitted when running
  non-debugger commands like 'offckb accounts' or 'offckb config list'.

  The WASI module is now only loaded when debugger functionality is
  actually executed.

  Fixes #405

- 4a88eb6: fix(install): force x86_64 architecture on Windows

  CKB only provides x86_64 binaries for Windows, not aarch64.
  When Windows ARM devices reported 'arm64' via os.arch(), the code
  tried to download a non-existent 'aarch64-pc-windows-msvc' binary,
  resulting in a 404 error.

  This fix forces all Windows systems to use x86_64, which:

  - Works correctly on Windows x64
  - Works via emulation on Windows ARM devices
  - Matches the only Windows binary CKB provides
